      "fact":"<p>Since war had broken out with Britain in May, 1803, French forces under General Gouvion Saint Cyr had been occupying coastal parts of Naples (the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, Taranto, Otranto, and Brindisi were all under French occupation). In late August, 1805, Napoleon reinforced St. Cyr's army with French forces from the Kingdom of Italy, and he ordered St. Cyr to depose the current rulers, establish a French regency, and then to defend against a potential Anglo-Russian landing. St. Cyr, however, was doubtful of his ability to execute this plan and Napoleon's initial plan was soon superseded by negotiations with the Neapolitan court for a treaty of neutrality. Once negotiations were concluded on September 23, St. Cyr was ordered to remain in Naples until the Neapolitans ratified the treaty (which it did on October 8), at which point St. Cyr was to evacuate Naples and move his forces north to the southern border of the Kingdom of Italy to cover the flank of Mass&#233;na's army from a possible Anglo-Russian landing in Naples.

      "title":"The Austrian War Plan",
      "fact":"<p>Of the three major coalition powers Austria was the most reluctant to go to war against France. Archduke Charles had long counseled against war on the grounds that Austria was unlikely to be able to defeat France on its own and was equally unlikely to receive sufficient assistance from either Great Britain (in the form of money) or Russia (in the form of troops). In opposition to Charles, Baron Karl von Mack, the general who would replace Charles as the emperor Francis's chief military advisor, and the foreign minister Ludwig Cobenzl, were more optimistic but, as Frederick Kagan has argued, Cobenzl's military optimism was driven as much by political imperatives as a realistic assessment of Austria's military position. </p><p>Ironically, it was Charles's own war plan, first devised in 1804 to illustrate for the emperor the difficulties Austria would face in a war against France, that served as the template for Mack's plan of the following year. This plan called for dividing Austrian forces into three armies, one of which would be deployed in northern Italy, the second in the Tyrol, and the third in southern Germany (these armies correspond to the commands of Archduke Charles in Italy, Archduke John and Hiller in the Tyrol, and Archduke Ferdinand and Mack in Germany). The Italian force would be the largest in anticipation of Italy as the major focus of French operations. The German army would invade Bavaria and hold a defensive position along the Iller River between Lake Constance and the Danube River in order to secure the rear of the Italian army. Once northern Italy was secured (along the Adda River to control the alpine passes), Austrian forces would invade France via Switzerland and the Franche Comt&#233;, presumably in early 1806. The plan reflected awareness of the vulnerability of Austria's left flank but not of its right flank in Germany.</p><p>At a conference in July, 1805, Russia agreed to support the Austrians with two armies. The first army was to enter Austrian territory from Brody on August 20 and begin arriving at Braunau on October 20. The second army was to depart from Brest at a date that was eventually pushed back to September 16, three weeks later than originally proposed. Until the arrival of the Russians, the Austrian army would be expected to hold off any French forces that might be operating in Germany or, as Charles put it in an August 29 memoranda, to withdraw to a more secure position either to the east at Salzburg or to the south in the Tyrol.</p><p>Though Charles remained pessimistic, the Austrian plan was finalized at a conference held on August 29 at the Hetzendorf Palace just outside Vienna. In Frederick Kagan's judgment: &rdquo;It was not a hopeless plan, nor was it doomed from the start. Despite its many failings, it was not a foolish undertaking. Considering the constraints on allied actions … it is not clear that there were better options. It was a plan, however, that relied for success on a great deal of good fortune, on skillful and resolute generals to execute it, and on a cooperative enemy. The allies, as it happened, had none of those advantages in the event.&rdquo; (Kagan, 357-58)</p>",

As his chief of staff Berthier explained to the Elector Max Joseph, however, the specifics of Napoleon's plans depended on &rdquo;the movement of the enemy&rdquo; and thus changed according to his knowledge of the location of the Austrian army and his understanding of Austrian intentions. These remained unclear until mid-September, when Napoleon began sketching plans for his movement to the Danube. </p><p>One of his first plans, dated September 17 (see map below), had French forces moving in an arc from Ulm to the northeast so as outflank an Austrian position on the Lech River and Augsburg. This plan, however, worked less well if the Austrians held Ulm, so when news arrived that the Austrian's were at Ulm, Napoleon developed another plan, dated September 20 (see second map below). This plan avoided Ulm altogether and called for a concentration of French forces along an east-west line to the northeast of Austrian positions in order to position his forces for a decisive battle with the Austrian army.</p> <p>Plans for the envelopment of Austrian forces deployed along the Stockach-Ulm line would gel over the next week as Napoleon continued to receive intelligence of the strength and location of Austrian forces (which was smaller than initially estimated). By September 26 he seems to have gained confidence in the idea of a massive turning movement east of Ulm that could entrap the bulk of the Austrian army and on September 28 he sketched a plan to that effect. As Napoleon wrote Bernadotte on September 27, &rdquo;if I have the good fortune that the Austrian army sleeps for three or four more days on the Iller and in the Black Forest, I will have turned it and I hope that nothing will escape but debris.&rdquo; (Kagan, 361-74)</p> <img src='images/napoleon_plans_sept.jpg'>",

By placing Austrian forces on the Iller, Mack had gone beyond what Francis had authorized, and when Ferdinand arrived to take command in Munich on September 20, he called off the forced marches that Mack had ordered. By now Mack was aware that the Austrian assumptions about Napoleon's own plans were wrong and their plan, with its emphasis on the Italian theatre, was misconceived. But instead of rethinking his strategy (the position on the Iller was originally intended to defend the northern flank of Austrian army but if Italy was no longer the focus, that line lost its importance: he could have pulled back to a less exposed position), Mack instead lobbied Francis for the transfer of forces from Italy and the Tyrol to Germany and the reinforcement of the Iller line.</p><p>To resolve these differences Francis met with Ferdinand and Mack at Landsberg on September 22. At this meeting Mack won the argument: the Austrian Army remained on Iller, Francis ordered Archduke Charles to send five infantry regiments to Innsbruck, and a new corps under Kienmayer was organized with the mission of observing Bernadotte's corps.

This was still larger than the French army under Mass&#233;na, which numbered about 40,000 along the Adige River, but not enough to establish the clear numerical superiority that Charles regarded as necessary for successful offensive operations. He thus took up a defensive position along the Adige River between Rivoli and Legnano.

However, it also came with political costs, as it drove Prussia closer into partnership with the Third Coalition, and most commentators have regarded the decision as a political error. For his part, the Prussian king Frederick William III felt pressured on all sides. Napoleon had been trying to entice the Prussia into an alliance, and while Frederick William III feared Russia more than he did France, he wished to remain neutral. Tsar Alexander's own war plan placed a Russian army on the Prussia border in order to coerce Frederick William into joining the coalition.

Although the map shows each Corps as occupying a single place, the user should imagine them as more spread out. Marmont's Corps, for instance, was spaced out along a three days march. On September 29, he thus informed Berthier that his 1st Division had arrived in W&#252;rzburg and that he expected his 2nd Division to arrive on September 30, and the 3rd Division on October 1. He did not expect any of his artillery to arrive until October 2 and did not expect to be able to move his Corps out until October 3.</p><p>Both corps were expected to obtain supplies in W&#252;rzburg. A supply agent had been sent in advance to locate supplies but neither commander was able to obtain what he had hoped. Bernadotte was short of cash, a topic he brought up on numerous occasions in his letters to Napoleon. As he wrote on September 28, &rdquo;I have no money to pay for [supplies] and it is only by a miracle what we have been able survive up to now. I thus dare to pray that Your Majesty see fit to put some money at my disposal.&rdquo;  The money was not forthcoming. On October 1 he reported that he was leaving W&#252;rzburg with only two days subsistence. When in neutral territory, he told Berthier, he would give “receipts for all that will be supplied to the troops.” In other words he planned on requisitioning supplies on the promise of future payment.</p><p>Marmont too was having difficulties feeding his troops. In a letter to Berthier on September 30, he described the situation as follows: &rdquo;As usual the troops are billeted with the population. No supply magazine has been established. The inspector of supplies sent here neither purchased anything, nor had made either bread or biscuit, and I am now greatly concerned about how I am going to feed my troops at the end of the march we are expected to conduct.&rdquo; </p><p>As with the whole of Napoleon's army, Marmont's troops were left to find what they could from the local population. What little testimony we possess from ordinary soldiers suggests that finding food was a constant preoccupation. Luckily for French soldiers, they were moving quickly through a region reasonably well stocked for food. As Jean-Pierre Blaise, a corporal in the III Corps, later recalled, &rdquo;The speed of our march made it impossible for supplies to keep pace with us, and so we were often short of bread in spite of all the efforts of our commanding general, Marshal Davout … Fortunately, it was the height of the potato season, and they were plentiful in our area. How many times did we ruin the hopes of the villagers! We pillaged from them the fruits of an entire year's work.&rdquo; As the campaign continued, however, and the French moved into areas where the Austrians had already been through, it became more difficult to locate foodstuffs. </p><p>The first three quotations are from Alombert and Colin, La campagne de 1805 en Allemagne, vol. 2, 152, 156, and 153-4.
